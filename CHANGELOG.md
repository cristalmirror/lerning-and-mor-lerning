## [0.0.6]

### Added
- Has created the operation `close_GDT();` ins tehe `linker.h` and `linker.c` for free
memory allocations of the graphes.
### Changed

### Fixed

- Has fixed the logical error to print vertex, now the vertex pointers has printed correctly

## [0.0.5] - 2026-05-1

### Changed

### Fixed
- Fix this error:
- ```c
  j=0 count=3
  p[0]=0
  p[1]=1
  p[2]=7
  j=1 count=1
  p[0]=8

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-23
### Added
- Initial project structure
- `function.c` with `graph_function`, `digraph_function`, and `tree_function` functions
